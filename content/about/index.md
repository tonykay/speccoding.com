An AI Lead at Red Hat, and very early into Spec whilst we were, and still are, working out just exactly what "Spec Coding" isprobably home i ended up with the domain! But 

Whilst I enjoy my work in inference and serving and have been doing more and more with `vLLM`, and the emerging `llm-d` on OpenShift(Kubernetes) my technical heart, or passions, lie much higher up the AI Stack in the realm of AI Engineering, Agentic AI, Context Engineering, MCP, and of course Spec Coding, hence this website.


### My Toolchain

OK, subject to change but 

- Claude Code (often inside Cursor; I'll write about why in the future)
- Specs, pretty much any of them including homespun but:
  - `spec-kit`
  - Kiro, Kiro was tremendously influential to me but too locked to AWS for day to day use
- 
- Languages 
  - Python
  - Ansible (ok: YAML, Jinja 2, Python but many of us consider it a language and well written _The Poetry of DevOps_)
